# Distributed-System
The final project is to build a small cloud platform, somewhat similar to Google Apps, but obviously with fewer features. 
The cloud platform will have a webmail service, analogous to Gmail, as well as a storage service, analogous to Google Drive.

## Major Components
* Distributed key-value storage
* Front-end server supporting POST requests, HEAD requests and cookie handling.
* User accounts management
* Webmail service(DNS, SMTP)
* Storage service(Fold Management)
* Admin Console
